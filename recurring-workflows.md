## Contribution Provider - Proof of Contribution Table for single tasks

**Before adding a pull request to this table [please read the BEST PRACTICES GUIDE](https://github.com/Morlabsai/Contributions/)**

## Structuring your Code Contributions.
All Code Contributions should include the following five elements:
1. The Ethereum / Wallet address to be rewarded.
2. Role Title 
3. Role Category (Design, Development, User Research, Product, Project Management, Finance, Strategy, Tokenomics, Recruitment, Operations, Community management, Marketing, Sales, Tech Research)
4. Link to Role Responsibilities.
5. Estimated value in USD (monthly)
6. Link to contributions (where the community can track your progress and see your work) 

Example fields below: 

| Wallet Address                             | Role Title | Role Category  | Role Responsibilities	| Estimated monthly Value USD |  Link to contributions | 
| 0x98eFf980C57c9D333340b3856481bF7B8698987c | Discord community manager | Development | https://github.com/Morlabsai/Contributions/roles |	4500 |  Discord community support / 40 hours per week |

Please include the "pipe" `|` symbol correctly as seen above so your contribution will format with the table.

> [!NOTE]
> - Create a pull request and add a row to the following table.  
> - If you are submitting multiple contributions, please create multiple pull requests - one pull request per contribution.  
> - Only add your link at the bottom, and do not alter any other rows.   
> - Detail the work you are contributing to Morpheus. You must include a link to the work for the work to be considered. Examples of proof include links to pull requests, github issues, or other easily verifyable information.  
> - It is your responsibility to make the proof easily verifiable. Don't assume reviewers of this table have an understanding of your code. Explain it simply. Limit your descriptions to 250 words.
> -  You need a wallet like Metamask that can receive Ethereum based tokens. MOR Labs token is an ERC-20 type token. Also must support Arbitrum.
